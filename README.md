# Fluids-Programs


There are a few different programs in this repository. They all were made to serve the same purpose; find an equivalent flow rate after scaling an experimental setup down. The experiment is modeled after the femoral vein, where there is a blood clot obstructing some of that vein. Due to the pulsatile nature and complex geometry, the scaling is not easy. Originally, I used scaling_code to find my equivalent flowrates when keeping wall shear stress constant, but my answers only work for pulsatile flow. For Reynolds_number_scaling, I kept reynolds number constant for my pulsatile flow and then got equivalent flow rates. For Scaling_via_math, I used derived solutions to the Navier stokes equation and kept shear stress constant to solve for my equivalent flowrates.
